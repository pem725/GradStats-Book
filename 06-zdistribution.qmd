# Expectation and Undertstanding: The Z-Distribution

Here we talk about the z-distribution and make sure we have plenty of funny pictures to make it WAY different than previous books on the topic.  Include here:

1.  The shape of the z-distribution
2.  The concept of the z-score
3.  The concept of the standard normal distribution
4.  The concept of the z-table
5.  The concept of the z-test
6.  The concept of the z-interval
7.  The concept of the z-proportion
8.  The concept of the z-confidence interval
9.  The concept of the z-hypothesis test

All of these points lead us to our inferential section.  We just want a deep dive into this distribution.  At the end, let's tell the readers that these concepts are the foundation for the inferential statistics we will cover in the next section.
