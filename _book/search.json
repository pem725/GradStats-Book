You are now on the online homepage of the book. As you will soon find out, the book is free (as in beer) and will remain that way for generations to come. Our aim is to create a single source for introductory to advanced social science statistics. Here, you will learn not just the how but the why.\nThe online version of the book is hosted at TBD and kept up-to-date on GitHub.",

    "text": "The thought of writing a textbook in my late 50’s seemed rather strange. Why now? What has yet to be said about statistics that cannot wait to be reiterated by a group of relative unknowns. Why this book? All good questions that I am not sure I can answer right now. What I can answer is that the world does need more, better, more interactive statistics (aka stats) books. The world needs more people who can think critically about data and the world needs more people who can communicate their findings in a clear and concise manner. This book is an attempt to address both of these needs. We hope you enjoy the journey.\n– Patrick E. McKnight"

    "text": "Why another statistics book?\nOften, people repeat themselves when they feel as if they were not heard. We educators, students, and graduates feel unheard when it comes to statistics. Those who teach statistics often feel like we are teaching the unteachable. Students struggle to meet the requirements of even the most basic statistics course. Statistics today requires some facility with math - at a minimum, arithmetic and algebra; for advanced students, integral calculus, linear algebra, and an understanding of probability density functions are extremely helpful. How do we educators address that requirement when our students come from many backgrounds and few possess the requisite knowledge to master this material?\nThe outcomes from our efforts are not all that impressive either. Students who take statistics courses often fail to grasp the material sufficiently to be considered knowledgeable about statistics. How could anyone grasp material that is beyond their scope of knowledge? Faculty in the social sciences have an even greater challenge. We must educate our students to a proficiency level that allows them to be educated consumers of the scientific literature. Without that knowledge, our graduates have little hope in discerning between science and nonsense. These students also need to be able to conduct research and communicate their findings. Doing so requires content knowledge beyond just statistics. Thus, we have a delicate balance to strike between teaching statistics and teaching the content of our disciplines.\nWe commonly see students failing to grasp these rudimentary concepts. The failures come from all parties. We educators use the same methods repeatedly expecting different results. Lectures followed by labs and homework produce rather poor results in student learning outcomes (CITE). Students fail to grasp the material because they tend not to read effectively and regularly while also avoiding application as if it were charged at an exorbitant rate. Read, play, and learn - our primary outcomes of interest. We want students to assume their responsibilities in learning; we educators need to assume responsibility for providing better tools. Here is our attempt to both focus on realizable outcomes and provide better tools.\n\nReading\nMost students stop reading the assignments because the assigned readings are often TOO dense and too tangential to their interests (e.g., sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll). The biggest obstacle is accessibility and readability. Texts that require students to lug around are less likely today to be used let alone read. We need material that is readily available to all users regardless of medium. A website works well for conveying this material provided the information “bits” are small and focused. Students gladly read if the material is readily available and focused on the points necessary for them to achieve their goals - often a grade. Some students, however, find mastery more to their liking. Regardless, both types of students need to read and read often. We hope to provide a text that is readily available and focused on the points necessary for students to achieve our collective goals.\n\n\nPlaying\nStudents need to play with statistics too. Heck, half the fun in statistics is seeing, controlling, and imagining the things that you could do with these tools.\n\n\nLearning\nquizzes coming at the end of each learning module.\nhttps://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/5115"
