Check these hints for yourself:\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you might find this book useful. We hope you read on.\nNot a graduate student? We do not care. Read the book. Arm yourself with knowledge of how uncertainty gets communicated. You - the reader - can make more informed decisions when you quantify your uncertainty. We wrote this book with graduate students in mind since most had a previous undergraduate course in statistics that, no doubt, was taught a very standard way. That way does not bode well for long-term retention. Most students forget the details and only a small minority retain the essentials. We assume only a passing familiarity. Most people have the background we assume in this book.\nStatistics is a tool to do one thing: quantify uncertainty. Approach the topic with that frame of reference and you will master statistics. How quickly? Depends upon your willingness to devote time to read and apply what you learn. We offer you a path towards understanding, quantifying and mastering your uncertainty. Good luck and welcome to the show.",

    "text": "Why another statistics book?\nThe corrolary to adage “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is “if it is broke, fix it.” We believe that statistics education is broken. Books are too expensive for the general public, immediately outdated upon publication, and often too dense for the average reader. We need a new approach to statistics education. An approach that involves the learners. We have an open text. Our efforts here are to preserve some of what we learned and hope many others will join us in this effort. We hope to provide a text that is readily available and focused on the points necessary for students to achieve our collective goals - to master statistics.\nWhat we have ain’t working. Often, people repeat themselves when they feel as if they were not heard. We educators, students, and graduates feel unheard when it comes to statistics. Those who teach statistics often feel like we are teaching the unteachable. Students struggle to meet the requirements of even the most basic statistics course. Statistics today requires some facility with math - at a minimum, arithmetic and algebra; for advanced students, integral calculus, linear algebra, and an understanding of probability density functions are extremely helpful. How do we educators address that requirement when our students come from many backgrounds and few possess the requisite knowledge to master this material? Well, we don’t know but what we are doing is not fixing the problem.\nUnfulfilled promises. The outcomes from our efforts are not all that impressive either. Students who take statistics courses often fail to grasp the material sufficiently to be considered knowledgeable about statistics. How could anyone grasp material that is beyond their scope of knowledge? Faculty in the social sciences have an even greater challenge. We must educate our students to a proficiency level that allows them to be educated consumers of the scientific literature. Without that knowledge, our graduates have little hope in discerning between science and nonsense.\nUnrealistic expectations abound. Many of these students need to be able to conduct research and communicate their findings. Doing so requires content knowledge beyond just statistics. Thus, we have a delicate balance to strike between teaching statistics and teaching the content of our disciplines.\nWe commonly see students failing to grasp rudimentary concepts. The failures come from all parties. We educators use the same methods repeatedly expecting different results. Lectures followed by labs and homework produce rather poor results in student learning outcomes; forget about far transfer. Students fail to grasp the material because they tend not to read effectively and regularly while also avoiding application as if it were charged at an exorbitant rate. Read, play, and learn - our primary outcomes of interest. We want students to assume their responsibilities in learning; we educators need to assume responsibility for providing better tools. Here is our attempt to both focus on realizable outcomes and provide better tools. Students and educators alike can come together to produce the best possible outcomes for all involved. Read, play, and learn.",

    "text": "Reading\nMost students stop reading the assignments because the assigned readings are often TOO dense and too tangential to their interests (e.g., sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll). The biggest obstacle is accessibility and readability. Texts that require students to lug around are less likely today to be used let alone read. We need material that is readily available to all users regardless of medium. A website works well for conveying this material provided the information “bits” are small and focused. Students gladly read if the material is readily available and focused on the points necessary for them to achieve their goals - often a grade. Some students, however, find mastery more to their liking. Regardless, both types of students need to read and read often. We hope to provide a text that is readily available and focused on the points necessary for students to achieve our collective goals.\n\n\nPlaying\nPlayful engagement. Students need to play with statistics. You may think you hate numbers but give us some time to convince you otherwise. Heck, half the fun in statistics is seeing, controlling, and imagining the things that you could do with these tools. Predict the stock prices of your favorite brand, the outcome of a sporting event, or the outcome of a relationship. These are just a few of the types of applications you can “play” with while learning these concepts. We want students to play with the data, the tools, and the concepts. That want comes with an expectation that such playful engagement produces thoughtful data analysts that desire to understand more from the data.\n\n\nLearning\nWe all learn by doing and the proof is in the pudding - so to speak. We want students to learn statistics by reading a little introductory material on a concept (see one), playing with the concept (do one), and then applying the concept to a real-world problem (teach one). We hope to provide a text that is readily available and focused on the points necessary for students to achieve our collective goals - to master statistics. Again, mastery is our goal.\nquizzes coming at the end of each learning module.\nhttps://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/5115",

    "text": "Ice Cream Preference\nImagine a boring world where everyone liked chocolate ice cream. We would have no need for statistics or science for prediction; we have both perfect prediction and certainty. If just one person liked vanilla instead of chocolate, we would have uncertainty - not much uncertainty because it would still be prudent to guess that everyone liked chocolate ice cream. One error that occurs 1/N times can be quite trivial with a large sample. This seemingly trivial example brings all of the statistics you need to undestand in English. Now, we need to take these ideas from English and convert them into statistical language. Don’t worry, the language will become second nature and your understanding will deepen with each passing use. We introduced many concepts in this first example including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables (and constants)\n\n\n\nA variable is a characteristic that can take on different values. In this case, the variable is the ice cream flavor that a person would order. The variable can take on different values such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, mint chip, and rocky road. A constant is a value that does not change. In this case, the constant is the number of people who like chocolate ice cream. Thus, you now know that when we say variable, we mean some characteristic that we may want to better understand (or use to predict something that we want to understand - more on that later). When we say constant, we mean a value that does not change. Variables vary; constants do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIANCE!\n\n\n\nYes, we yelled it. If you learn nothing else from this resource, please master VARIANCE. As we alluded to above, the characteristics that we measure differ between people (e.g., height) and within a person (e.g., weight). To our example, we can imagine ice cream preference differing between people (i.e., some people prefer vanilla to chocolate) and within each (i.e., our tastes change as we age). The differences between or changes within are variance. You will learn that there are formal definitions, graphical depictions, and qualifiers to variance. For now, remember that variance is a measure of how much difference exists in your variables. More differences are preferable to fewer differences. Why? Differences are what we study. We study differences to understand the world around us. We study differences to predict the future. We study differences to control the world around us. Variance is the measure of differences and, as a result, variance is the measure of uncertainty.

Science is not a lock-step path of hypothesis generation, stringent testing, and careful reporting. Quite the contrary! There are scoundrels amongst us. Some fabricate data. Some fabricate studies. Most of us do our best to conduct research consistent with our scientific mission - to describe, predict, and control the world around us. That sounds so sinister but those are the aims of science. Instead of the lock-step scientific method, we often come up with questions that are routinely rejected (\\(p &gt; 0.05\\)) by data we scarcely know much about regarding the reliability or, gasp, the validity of our measures. That house of cards leads to many researchers hunting for new, potential findings worthy of further inquiry. Failed tests lead to fishing expeditions to find something worthy of publication. Why? We must publish to keep our jobs. So, we find stuff to publish. Failed initial tests? Don’t despair! You will find something to report in every dataset. Sir Ronald Fisher, interpreted the results of significant hypothesis tests worthy of further study - nothing more. He too opined that such tests were mere reason for optimism and not the ultimate arbiter of scientific relevance. Thus, all findings are findings worthy of further study. Sometimes, that further study stops with greater care and attention to the data; other times, we must conduct further empirical investigations to rule out alternative explanations.

    "text": "1.2 Variables\nEverything we wish to understand about people or things comes in the form of a variable. If I want to know why people like chocolate ice cream, I must assign some form of numerical value to “like” such that I can learn from my observations. Why? Learning via these methods require data. Each variable is a set of observations. We assign numbers to observations and these observations serve as our data. Each variable is unique. Some variables contain data that represent a singular characteristic of a person or thing; other variables contain data that represent multiple characteristics. These characteristics we often call constructs in psychological science. From this point forward, we shall refer to the underlying characteristic that we measure as the construct.\nLet’s examine this a bit more closely. Consider two variables height and weight. Height is a variable that contains data representing a singular characteristic of a person - the length of the person’s body when standing. Changes in height measures a singular characteristic of a person that can be altered only by skeletal growth/decay. Weight, on the other hand, contains data representing a single characteristic (mass) but determined by many contributing factors (e.g., water, fat, muscle, bone, etc.). Combined, height and weight make a composite variable called Body Mass Index (BMI) - an often used but derided predictor of health and well-being.\n\n\n\n\nSingular Construct\nMultiple Constructs\n\n\n\n\nSingular Cause\nIDEAL (Height)\nLess IDEAL (Weight)\n\n\nMultiple Cause\nMost Common (g)\nREALLY BAD (BMI)\n\n\n\nIn the table above, we see that the ideal variable is one that contains data representing a singular characteristic of a person and is determined by a singular cause. Similarly, we see BMI labeled as “REALLY BAD.” These are abstractions right now but they become important as we delve into psychological science and the uncertainty around our constructs.\n\n1.2.1 Types of Variables\nWe have many types of variables to choose from when we begin our journey into data land. Each type of variable has its own unique characteristics and uses. Let’s explore the most common types of variables. Decades ago, psychological scientists were hamstrung by W.W. Stevens levels of measurement. Stevens argued that there were four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These levels of measurement were used to determine the permissible analyses based solely on the logic of arithmetic. Times have changed but arithmetic remains the same. The argument, however, that the level of measurement dictates the analysis is simply untrue. We may do whatever analysis we choose. Which ones make sense depends upon a whole host of factors that we address in this book. So, keep reading. Below is a much easier taxonomy for understanding variables.\n\n1.2.1.1 Continuous Variables\nContinuous variables are those that can take on any value within a range. These variables are often measured and can be divided into smaller and smaller units. Examples of continuous variables include height, weight, and temperature. We care not only about the integer values (e.g., 5 feet) but also the decimal values as well (e.g., 5.5 feet). Continuous variables are the most commonly assumed type of variable in psychological science. We emphasize assumed here because we see many instances where continuity - that is, the continuous nature of a variable - makes no sense and yet, in those instances, are treated as such. EGAD! What are we to do? Well, we must learn. So, a continuous variable is a variable containing any value between a range of possible values including negative and positive infinity.\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Discrete Variables\n\n\n1.2.1.3 Categorical Variables\n\n\n1.2.1.4 Ordinal Variables\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Representing Variables Numerically\n\n\n1.2.3 Plotting Variables\n\n1.2.3.1 Histograms",
