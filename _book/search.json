    "text": "Welcome\nWe welcome you to the first, freely available and freely editable online graduate statistics textbook whereby all readers may participate in the continued development of a first-rate resource. You are now on the online homepage of the book. As you will soon find out, the book is free (as in beer) and will remain that way for generations to come. Our aim is to create a single source for introductory to advanced social science statistics. Here, you will learn not just the how but the why.\nThe online version of the book is hosted at TBD and kept up-to-date on GitHub.\nThe work here represents a huge breakthrough in licensing and distribution of textbooks. Permit us to provide some context to that bold statement. Some years ago, one of us (PEM) wrote a book with his colleagues on missing data ([McKnight2007])."

    "text": "The journey of learning statistics must start with the first general principle - uncertainty or rather quantifying uncertainty. To fully grasp the concept of uncertainty, we offer you a simple exercise. Suppose you were to guess the weight of any adult family member. Your best guess would likely be off. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that the best guess is the arithmetic mean. Why?"
