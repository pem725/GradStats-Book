# Welcome {.unnumbered}

We welcome you to the first, freely available and freely editable online graduate statistics textbook whereby all readers may participate in the continued development of a first-rate resource. You are now on the online homepage of the book. As you will soon find out, the book is free (as in beer) and will remain that way for generations to come. Our aim is to create a single source for introductory to advanced social science statistics. Here, you will learn not just the how but the why.

The online version of the book is hosted at [TBD](https://TBDURL) and kept up-to-date on [GitHub](https://github.com/pem725/GradStats-Book).
