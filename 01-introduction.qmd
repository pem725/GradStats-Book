# Introduction {#intro}

The journey of learning statistics must start with the first general principle - uncertainty or rather quantifying uncertainty.  To fully grasp the concept of uncertainty, we offer you a simple exercise.  Suppose you were to guess the weight of any adult family member.  Your best guess would likely be off.  Empirical evidence, however, suggests that the best guess is the arithmetic mean.  Why?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Wts <- c(125,189,220,175,145,147,256,127,155,184)



```
