# Validity (not Reliability)

We need to talk about the varying features of validity including:

1.  Content Validity
2.  Criterion Validity
3.  Construct Validity
4.  Face Validity
5.  Convergent Validity
6.  Discriminant Validity

More importantly, these forms of validity often focus solely on the variables or measures.  We have other forms of validity worth discussing including:

1.  Internal Validity
2.  External Validity
3.  Statistical Conclusion Validity

These forms need their own attention since they involve the process of learning and understanding the quality of our inferences.
