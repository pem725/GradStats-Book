# Simple Regression

We begin with a simple bivariate (two variable) model with one outcome and one predictor.  The reason we start with this basic model is to help new users understand the output and details without adding too many other details into the mix.  So, we start with the easiest model - the bivariate regression model.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the purpose of the model.
2. Learn how to interpret the output of a bivariate regression model.
3. Understand how to use the model to make predictions.
4. Learn how to evaluate the model's performance.
