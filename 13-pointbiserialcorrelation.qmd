# Bridging the Gap: The Point Biserial Correlation

The point biserial correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between a continuous variable and a dichotomous variable. It is a special case of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, which is used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.  Why is this so important?  Well, the point biserial correlation ($r_{pb}$) is the key to bridging the gap between continuous and dichotomous variables - a gap caused by the shift from one GLM model (MRC with continuous) to another (ANOVA with discrete or categorical predictors).
