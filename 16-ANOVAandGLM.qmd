# Moving to ANOVA

This chapter has the potential to be too large.  We need some material to precede this material.  What may that be?

1. Coding of categorical variables (ordered vs. unordered).  Should we address this point throughout?  I suggest we do.  Start with distributions.  Make the reader understand that all data can be used.
2. Testing - specifically t-tests.  I think they have that material already by now.
3. Regression - they have that material already.
